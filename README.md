## Introduction

Serenity Security is a comprehensive vulnerability management platform designed to help users identify, track, and remediate security vulnerabilities across their digital assets. The application enables users to register and monitor multiple system assets, scan for vulnerabilities using real-time CVE data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Api, generate detailed security reports, and generate and track remediation progress.

- Real-time reports with detailed vulnerability information and actionable results

### Custom Remediation Checklists

- Automatically generated remediation steps for each vulnerability
- Custom algorithm analyzes multiple data points and keywords to provide tailored remediation guidance
- Track remediation progress with interactive verification steps and completion status

### Data Visualization with Recharts

- Donut charts showing vulnerability severity distribution
- Color-coded visualizations using a custom security-focused palette:
  - High severity: #a83246 (muted red)
  - Medium severity: #d9b55a (muted yellow)
  - Low severity: #5a9178 (muted green)
- Responsive design that scales across different device sizes

### Matrix-Inspired Animated Theme System
